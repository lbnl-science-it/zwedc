<UL>
<LI> Odor is very subjective. Unpleasant odors in 5 to 10 ou/m^3 range usually trigger complaints.
<LI> Model assume a dry Anaerobic Digestion facility with full capacity of 90,000 ton/year for organic waste.
<LI> Map represents the top 2 percentile in the distribution of the simulated odor concentrations over a three year period. 
<LI> The facility assumes bagged outdoor composting as practiced at ZBest.
<LI> Additional funding would be needed for data collection and further refine the models, they are very preliminary and used for demo purposes only.
